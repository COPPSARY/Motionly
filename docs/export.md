# Export

## Current Editor Support

Motionly currently exposes MP4 export in the top toolbar.

- Uses the project's canvas resolution and FPS
- Shows export progress in the toolbar
- Downloads a file named after the current `.motion` project
- Disables or reports an error when the browser cannot record MP4

The current path uses browser `MediaRecorder`, so export runs in real time and can lose pacing if the browser throttles or the renderer cannot keep up. Keep the editor tab active while exporting.

Audio is not currently included in exported MP4 files.

WebM and GIF code exists internally but is not a supported editor workflow yet.

## Near-Term Work

- Deterministic frame capture
- Stable frame pacing, duration, and audio synchronization
- Audio inclusion in MP4 output
- Visual 24, 30, and 60 FPS choices
- Resolution and aspect-ratio presets
- 720p, 1080p, 1440p, and 4K output choices
- Clear cancellation and failure handling
- WebM, GIF, PNG stills, and image-sequence export

## Export Rules

- Render from the same scene graph as preview
- Never mutate the source scene or loaded assets
- Make output settings explicit
- Report unsupported browsers and failures clearly
- Prefer reliable output over a large format list
