# Using Agents And LLMs With Motionly

An agent or LLM can create the first `.motion` draft. Motionly then lets you inspect, edit, preview, save, and export that draft visually.

## Repository Instructions

Ask the agent to read these files before writing a project:

- `AGENTS.md` for product boundaries and core syntax
- `.agents/skills/write-motionly/SKILL.md` for the authoring workflow
- `.agents/skills/write-motionly/references/motion-syntax.md` for supported presets and properties

The `write-motionly` skill is designed for Codex and other agentic tools that can read repository files. Other LLMs can use the same files as prompt context.

## Prepare Your Project

1. Create a folder such as `video-motion/assets/my-project/`.
2. Add the images, SVGs, logos, and audio references needed for the story.
3. Keep original aspect ratios and use clear filenames.
4. Provide the script, target duration, canvas ratio, and preferred output path.
5. Tell the agent which text must appear exactly and provide narration timestamps when available.

Images and SVGs can be imported into `.motion`. Audio is currently attached through the editor for preview and is not persisted or exported. Video clip support is roadmap work.

## Prompt Template

```text
Read AGENTS.md, .agents/skills/write-motionly/SKILL.md, and its syntax reference.

Create an editable Motionly project at video-motion/my-project.motion.

Goal:
[Describe the animation and audience.]

Assets:
video-motion/assets/my-project/

Script and timing:
[Paste the script and timestamps, or provide the audio path.]

Requirements:
- Inspect every relevant asset before placing it.
- Storyboard distinct shots before writing the file.
- Give each shot one clear focal subject.
- Use only syntax and presets already supported by Motionly.
- Preserve supplied copy exactly when it must match narration.
- Avoid accidental overlap, repeated fade-only scenes, and random camera movement.
- Ask before generating or converting visual assets when that would materially help.
- Parse and validate the final project, then inspect representative frames.

Return a complete .motion project that I can refine in the visual editor.
```

## Replace The Sample

To start from the included sample:

1. Copy `video-motion/motionly.motion` to a new project name.
2. Remove only the sample assets you no longer need.
3. Put your own files in a dedicated asset folder.
4. Ask the agent to replace all old imports and remove unused layers.
5. Open the generated project in Motionly and refine it visually.

Do not ask the agent to invent unsupported engine features. Add missing editor or renderer capabilities as separate engineering work.

## Review The Result

Before export:

- Confirm the canvas size, FPS, and duration.
- Scrub every scene transition.
- Check text wrapping, image aspect ratios, and layer overlap.
- Confirm entrances and exits match the script.
- Save the edited `.motion` file.
- Remember that MP4 export does not include attached audio yet.

Generated output is a starting point, not a black-box final video.
